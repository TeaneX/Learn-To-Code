### HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.

The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

---

### The `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines the document type and helps browsers display web pages correctly.

- It must appear only once, at the very top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    
- It is not case-sensitive.
    
- The declaration for HTML5 is:
    

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined using the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags:

- `<h1>` defines the most important heading.
    
- `<h6>` defines the least important heading.
    

**Example:**

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
```

---

### HTML Paragraphs

HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

---

### HTML Links

HTML links are created using the `<a>` tag.

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

- The destination URL is specified using the `href` attribute.
    
- Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
    
- You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.

### HTML Images

HTML images are added with the `<img>` tag. You can specify the source file (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), width, and height using attributes.

**Example:**

```html
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
```

### How to View HTML Source

- **View HTML Source Code:**
    
    - Press `CTRL + U` on a web page, or right-click and select **"View Page Source"**. This will open a new tab showing the HTML code of the page.
        
- **Inspect an HTML Element:**
